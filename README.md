WPInfo displays system information on the Windows wallpaper. It works similarly to BGInfo from SysInternals but it adds a few unique features:

* Picks the background image most appropriate for the current screen resolution from a configured folder.
* Overlays any number of additional images on the background (great to display a logo without stretching it).
* Configurable text box can be displayed below the information text.
* Supports image formats handled by the .Net framework, including 32bpp PNGs with an alpha channel (great for shadows).
* Plain XML configuration files.
* You have access to the c# source code!


I have successfully used WPInfo on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 (32 and 64bits).

Feedback is welcome!
